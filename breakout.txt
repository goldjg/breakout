Not bad, not bad
Yeah, I, I think if you do that, Roger, it'll be beautiful
So, it doesn't sound like everybody went to the middle eight (no problem)
And then you keep on to the bell
I think it's much more refined
Okay, another one from the top
I wake up
I feel fine
Your face
Chills my spine
Honey, you're touchin' something deep inside of me
Honey, you're touchin' something, you're touchin' me
I'm under your thumb, under your spell
Can't you see? Yeah
If I could only reach you
If I could make you smile
If I could only reach you
That would really be a breakthrough
(Oh, I love it, love that one)
Your smile
Speaks books to me
I break up
But everybody knows who looks at me
Honey, you're sparking something deep inside of me
A flame that's burning brightly, it's taking over me
I'm out of control, out of my head
Can't you see, baby?
If I could only reach you
If I could make you smile
If I could only reach you
That would really be a breakthrough
If I could only reach you
If I could make you smile
If I could only reach you
That would really be a breakthrough
these barriers of pain
(Breakthrough) yeah, to the sunshine from the rain
Make my feelings known towards you
Turn my heart inside and out for you now
Somehow I have to make this final breakthrough
Breakthrough, breakthrough, breakthrough, yeah!
Hit it
Ha
Somebody else's affair
Somebody else's affair
Growing up (who says that?)
It's hard for you (tell me about it)
Everybody tells you so
But you ought to know
Hey, hey, hey, hey, yeah
Maybe you're breathing in somebody else's air
Maybe you're trapped in somebody else's sordid life affair
If I could only reach you
If I could make you smile
If I could only reach you
That would really be a breakthrough
If I could only reach you
If I could make you smile
If I could only reach you
That would really be a breakthrough
You know something?
If this song would stop right now
This would really be a breakthrough for me
I mean, if I would drop dead
That would be a breakthrough, honey
It would be a breakthrough
It would be a breakthrough
Hey, yes
Ha
It would be a breakthrough
Breakthrough, breakthrough
Oh, ah, I love it
Bop, ba-bop, ba-bop, ba-bop, ba-bop
